this is a thing
- defaultdict(list) (creates a dictionary with defaulted value [])


dictionaries
- mutable objects aren't hashable
- - dictionaries themselves can't be keys

remember heapq sorts by index 0 first

Kruskal: need GLOBAL minheap. not per node choose best
- example 
Index 0: X = (0,0)
Index 1: A = (1,0)
Index 2: B = (0,2)
Index 3: C = (0,3)
Starting from X, you connect X and A. However, then at A, you woudl then connect A with B
